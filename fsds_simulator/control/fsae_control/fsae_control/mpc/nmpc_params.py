# Title: nmpc_params.py

"""
nmpc_params.py — STRUCTURAL/SOLVER tunables for the NONLINEAR MPC
path-tracking controller (nmpc_core.NMPCController). See
late_turn_in_investigation.md Part 16 for the research/decision record
behind the formulation.

WHAT LIVES HERE VS. IN mpc_params.py
--------------------------------------------------------
NMPC weight overrides live in mpc_params.py's MPCParams; this file holds
only structural/solver fields with no LTV-QP analogue. Do not re-add
weight fields here — see mpc_params.py instead.

What remains here are fields that have NO LTV-QP analogue to inherit
from — horizon length, SQP iteration count, trust-region size, solver
tolerances, curvature-smoothing parameters. These are genuinely NMPC-only
mechanics, not "MPC weights" in the sense the rest of MPCParams's fields
are.

PARITY, NOW THAT AN OFFLINE NMPC EXISTS
-----------------------------------------
Before fsae_MPCTest's offline NMPC port (controller/nmpc_optimiser.py),
these structural fields had no offline counterpart, so CLAUDE.md's
numeric-parity rule didn't apply to them. It does now: every field below
has a matching settings.py NMPC_* constant (see that file's "Nonlinear MPC
(NMPC)" section), kept numerically identical by hand — the same
discipline as Q_diag/R_diag/R_rate_diag always have been. Extend both
sides together if either changes.

ONE WEIGHT (now in mpc_params.py) DOES NOT TRANSFER WITH IDENTICAL
MEANING: q_r / nmpc_q_epsi_dot. In the LTV-QP it weights absolute yaw rate
`r`; in the Frenet NMPC it weights the heading-error RATE
`r - kappa*s_dot` (see nmpc_core._outputs). Penalising absolute `r` in a
curvature-aware model would penalise the yaw rate the car MUST hold to
follow a corner (r = kappa*v), i.e. it would fight cornering — which is
the exact failure this controller exists to remove. Same number,
different regressor: expect to re-sweep it. See Part 16 §16.3 choice (1),
and mpc_params.py's own docstring for the field itself.

PROVENANCE OF EVERY DEFAULT BELOW
---------------------------------
No default here is a fresh guess. Each is either (a) copied from an existing
validated value in mpc_core.py / control_utils.py (noted per field), or
(b) a solver/structural setting measured in Part 16 §16.7, or (c) an explicit
guard whose value is chosen to be inert on this car's real operating range
(also noted). Anything that is genuinely unvalidated says so in its `desc`.
