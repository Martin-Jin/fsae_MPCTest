# Planning/Control Upstream Sync

Reference for re-syncing this repo's `planning/` package and `fsds_simulator/`
staging files against a newer clone of the upstream
[`fsae_planning`](https://github.com/UOA-FSAE/fsae_planning) repo. Read this
before touching either directory during a resync — it records which files
mirror which upstream files, which pieces are deliberately *not* mirrored (and
why), and the numeric-parity constants that must stay matched across the
offline/live boundary.

**`fsds_simulator/` is a staging area, not a live module.** It mirrors
`fsae_planning`'s own ROS 2 workspace hierarchy exactly — every package
(`common/fsae_interfaces`, `common/fsae_bringup`, `perception/
fsae_sim_perception`, `planning/fsae_planning`, `control/fsae_control`), not
just the control-layer files — so the whole thing can be copied straight
across into a workspace `src/` at the same relative paths with no manual
re-pathing and no missing scaffolding (`package.xml`/`setup.py`/`setup.cfg`/
`resource/` included). See `fsds_simulator/README.md` for the build/run
instructions this enables. Nothing under `fsds_simulator/` is imported by
`gui/simulation.py`, `tuner/offline_tuner.py`, or anything else in this repo —
those all live under `planning/`, `sim/`, `model/`, `controller/` instead.
`fsds_simulator/` exists purely so this repo can hold, version, and hand off a
ready-to-build copy of the ROS 2 side — including to someone who has only
this repo and FSDS, with no separate `fsae_planning` checkout at all.

**Last resynced:**
- Expanded from a control-layer-only mirror to the full workspace: added
  `common/fsae_interfaces` (message package), the rest of `common/fsae_bringup`
  (`fsae_params.yaml`, `perception.launch.py`, `planning.launch.py`,
  `sim.launch.py`, full package scaffolding), all of `planning/fsae_planning`
  as a real package (previously only `planning/` at this repo's root held the
  algorithm-only mirror — see the file mapping below, that mirror is
  unchanged), `perception/fsae_sim_perception`'s package scaffolding, and
  `control/fsae_control`'s remaining nodes: `fsds_bridge.py`,
  `stanley_controller.py`, `mpc_controller.py`, `telemetry_logger.py`, plus
  package scaffolding. **The frozen `fsds_simulator/stanley_controller/`
  reference implementation (`stanley_control.py` / `stanely_control_utils.py`,
  targeting an old `/fsds/planned_path`+`Track` interface and importing a
  never-defined `separate_cones_by_color`) was deleted** and replaced by the
  real, current `stanley_controller.py` (mirroring upstream's actual node,
  which uses `control_utils.py`'s `StanleyController` — see "Deliberately not
  mirrored" below, that exclusion no longer applies).
- `planning/` (`boundary.py`, `cone_sorting.py`, `path_utils.py`) brought to
  parity with the `fsae_planning` checkout in `ros2/src/fsae_planning/` in
  this repo's sibling directory. This dropped the `build_path_trace` ft-fsd
  trace-sort planner (upstream removed it — see "Deliberately not mirrored"
  below), renamed `_build_wall_segments` → `build_wall_segments` and added
  `segment_crosses_walls` (both now public), and added `roll_loop_to_car` (a
  skidpad-support helper — see its own note below). `cone_sorting.py` also
  lost some already-dead commented-out code (`separate_cones_by_color`, an
  unused `Cone` import) that upstream had already cleaned up.
- `fsds_simulator/` reorganised from a flat folder (`control_node.py`,
  `mpc_core.py`, `control_utils.py` all directly inside `fsds_simulator/`)
  into the mirrored hierarchy described above, and its old `control_node.py`
  was retired entirely in favour of upstream's `mpc_controller_standalone.py`
  (see "What replaced `control_node.py`" below — this is a same-design,
  different-file swap, not a like-for-like rename).

## File mapping

| This repo | Upstream (`fsae_planning`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `planning/boundary.py` | `planning/fsae_planning/fsae_planning/boundary.py` | Direct mirror |
| `planning/cone_map.py` | `planning/fsae_planning/fsae_planning/cone_map.py` | Direct mirror |
| `planning/cone_sorting.py` | `planning/fsae_planning/fsae_planning/cone_sorting.py` | Direct mirror |
| `planning/path_utils.py` | `planning/fsae_planning/fsae_planning/path_utils.py` | Direct mirror |
| — (no file counterpart) | `planning/fsae_planning/fsae_planning/centerline_planner.py` | The ROS 2 planner node itself. Its behaviour (temporal centreline blending via `blend_paths()`, called every planning tick) is reproduced inline by `sim/sim_track.py`'s `SimPlanner.update()` rather than as a ported file — the simulator has no separate planner *node*, `SimPlanner` plays that role directly. This is `planning/`'s own algorithm-only mirror; the full node **is** mirrored under `fsds_simulator/` (see below) since that folder mirrors the whole workspace, not just simulator-relevant algorithm code. |

`planning/` (this repo's root-level folder, used by `gui/simulation.py` /
`tuner/offline_tuner.py`) and `fsds_simulator/` (the ROS 2 staging mirror,
used by nobody in this repo — see above) both track upstream, but serve
different purposes and are mapped separately. `fsds_simulator/` mirrors
upstream's **entire** workspace — every package, including scaffolding
(`package.xml`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `resource/`) — not just the files an
offline tuner cares about:

| `fsds_simulator/` path | Upstream (`fsae_planning`) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `common/fsae_interfaces/` (whole package) | `common/fsae_interfaces/` | Direct mirror. Message definitions (`Track`, `ConeDetection`, `CAN`, …) every other package depends on. |
| `common/fsae_bringup/` (whole package) | `common/fsae_bringup/` | Direct mirror. `config/fsae_params.yaml` (central tunables), all 5 launch files (`sim.launch.py`, `control.launch.py`, `planning.launch.py`, `perception.launch.py`, `cone_recorder.launch.py`). |
| `perception/fsae_sim_perception/` (whole package) | `perception/fsae_sim_perception/` | Direct mirror. `sim_perception.py` (FSDS oracle+odom → `/fsae/*`) + `cone_recorder.py`. |
| `planning/fsae_planning/` (whole package) | `planning/fsae_planning/` | Direct mirror. `centerline_planner.py` (the actual ROS 2 node — see the row above for why the root `planning/` folder doesn't have this), `boundary.py`, `cone_map.py`, `cone_sorting.py`, `path_utils.py`, `special_utils/` (skidpad). |
| `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_core.py` | `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_core.py` | Direct mirror. The `MPCController` class — QP-based MPC, kept in byte-for-byte parity with `sim/rollout_core.py`/`controller/optimiser.py` per this repo's own numeric-parity rule (see `CLAUDE.md`). |
| `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/control_utils.py` | `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/control_utils.py` | Direct mirror — includes both `curvature_speed()` and `StanleyController`. |
| `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/stanley_controller.py` | `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/stanley_controller.py` | Direct mirror. The actual current `controller:=stanley` node (publishes `cmd_vel`, routes through `fsds_bridge`). Replaces the old frozen reference implementation — see "Last resynced" above. |
| `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_controller.py` | `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_controller.py` | Direct mirror. Upstream's default `controller:=mpc` node — steering only through `cmd_vel`/`fsds_bridge`, discards the MPC's own throttle/brake. See "Two MPC-controller nodes" below. |
| `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_controller_standalone.py` | `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_controller_standalone.py` | Direct mirror. See "What replaced `control_node.py`" for the history. |
| `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/fsds_bridge.py` | `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/fsds_bridge.py` | Direct mirror. Needed by both `stanley_controller.py` and `mpc_controller.py` (not `mpc_controller_standalone.py`, which bypasses it). |
| `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/telemetry_logger.py` | `control/fsae_control/fsae_control/telemetry_logger.py` | Direct mirror. CSV telemetry shared by all three controller nodes. |
| `control/fsae_control/setup.py` | `control/fsae_control/setup.py` | Direct mirror. Registers all four console-script entry points (`controller`, `mpc_controller`, `mpc_controller_standalone`, `fsds_bridge`). |

`planning/` (root) and the `MPCController` half of `mpc_core.py` are shared
algorithm code and should track upstream closely. `mpc_controller_standalone.py`
is this repo's own integration pattern, ported upstream and then kept in the
mirror going forward — it's expected to diverge in upstream-specific ways
(topic names, message types) while keeping the same behavioural design.

### Two MPC-controller nodes, plus Stanley

### What replaced `control_node.py`

This repo used to have its own `fsds_simulator/control_node.py`, targeting an
older ROS 2 topic/message interface (`/fsds/planned_path` as `nav_msgs/Path`,
`/FusionCones` as `fs_msgs/Track`) that no longer exists in current
`fsae_planning`. It has been retired and its design ported into upstream's
package as a new file, **`mpc_controller_standalone.py`**, updated for the
current topics (`/fsae/planning/selected_trajectory`, `/fsae/slam/
car_position`, `/fsae/perception/cone_detection`). The mirror in this repo
now holds that upstream file directly — there is no separate
`control_node.py` anymore, in either repo.

This matters because `fsae_planning` actually has **two** MPC-controller node
files, and they are not interchangeable:

- **`mpc_controller.py`** — upstream's original `controller:=mpc` node.
  Publishes `ackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped` (steering + target speed)
  on the shared `cmd_vel` interface and lets `fsds_bridge.py`'s simple
  speed-error P-loop compute throttle/brake, and own GO-gating/cone-braking,
  identically to the Stanley controller. It **discards** the MPC's own
  throttle/brake output. Unchanged, still exists, still the default.
- **`mpc_controller_standalone.py`** — the new node this repo's old
  `control_node.py` was ported into. Publishes `fs_msgs/ControlCommand`
  directly, using `MPCController.compute()`'s `(steering, throttle, brake)`
  output unchanged (preserving the offline-tuned longitudinal behaviour this
  repo's tuner produces), and re-implements GO-hold/stale-path-brake/
  cone-proximity-brake itself instead of relying on `fsds_bridge.py`.
  Selected via `controller:=mpc_standalone` in `control.launch.py`, which
  skips `fsds_bridge` for that mode.

If you're resyncing this repo's mirror against a newer `fsae_planning`,
diff `mpc_controller_standalone.py` against `mpc_controller_standalone.py` —
**not** against `mpc_controller.py`. `mpc_controller.py`'s accel-discarding
design has no counterpart in this repo at all; don't try to reconcile the
two, they're deliberately different controllers reusing the same
`MPCController` QP core.

## Deliberately not mirrored

- **The old frozen Stanley reference** (previously at
  `fsds_simulator/stanley_controller/stanely_control_utils.py` +
  `stanley_control.py`) — **removed**. It targeted an old
  `/fsds/planned_path`+`Track` interface, was not kept in sync with upstream,
  and imported a `separate_cones_by_color` helper that isn't defined anywhere
  in either repo. The real, current `StanleyController` (in
  `control_utils.py`) and `stanley_controller.py` node are now mirrored
  instead, kept in sync like everything else under `fsds_simulator/`. If you
  find an older local copy of this repo with the frozen reference still
  present, that's the *previous* state — don't resurrect it.
- **`roll_loop_to_car`** (added to upstream's `path_utils.py`) — a
  closed-loop-reordering helper upstream's skidpad planner uses to follow a
  known figure-8. Ported here for parity (see "Last resynced" above) but
  **this repo has no skidpad mode**, so nothing calls it yet. Keep it if you
  resync again rather than stripping it as dead code — it's parity, not
  scope creep — but don't expect to exercise it until/unless a skidpad
  characterisation mode is added here too.
- **The ft-fsd trace-sort planner (`build_path_trace` and its private
  helpers)** — upstream removed this entirely (see "Last resynced" above);
  it is gone from this repo's `boundary.py` too as of the same resync. If an
  older local copy of this repo still has it, that's the *previous* state,
  not something to re-add.
- **The offline oracle speed-profile array** (`sim/speed_profile.py`'s
  `compute_speed_profile()` / `smooth_profile()`) — used only for the
  synthetic/oracle path in `tuner/offline_tuner.py` and `gui/simulation.py`'s
  exact-path mode. Upstream replaced the equivalent live-path logic with a
  scalar `curvature_speed()` call, but this repo deliberately keeps the
  precomputed-array version for the oracle path: it's static across a whole
  rollout, so precomputing it once is a performance win with no accuracy
  cost. The live-path `curvature_speed()`'s dense-resample-and-denoise step
  exists specifically to combat frame-to-frame replanning jitter — a static
  oracle path never has that problem, so there is no equivalent upstream
  logic to port back for the oracle branch. `sim/sim_track.py`'s `SimPlanner`
  correspondingly emits only `.centreline` (no `.v_profile`), matching
  upstream's planner-emits-path-only design; the live-planner branch derives
  its speed on demand via `speed_profile.curvature_speed()` instead.

## Numeric-parity constants

These pairs must stay numerically identical across the offline/live
boundary, or offline-tuned weights will not transfer faithfully to the live
controller. Line numbers below were confirmed by grep at the time of
writing — re-confirm before relying on them, since a resync can move them.

| Constant | Offline copy | Live copy | Current value |
|---|---|---|---|
| `curvature_speed()`'s `a_lat_max` | `sim/speed_profile.py:328` (function default) | `fsds_simulator/control/fsae_control/fsae_control/control_utils.py:37` (function default) | `4.0` |
| Planner top/bottom speed clamp | `sim/rollout_core.py:55-56` (`PLANNER_V_MAX`, `PLANNER_V_MIN`) | `fsds_simulator/control/fsae_control/fsae_control/mpc_controller_standalone.py` (declared as the `v_max`/`v_min` ROS parameters, default `20.0`/`1.5`) | `20.0` / `1.5` |

Notes on how these are actually used:

- `sim/speed_profile.py`'s `curvature_speed()` (the offline mirror of
  `control_utils.py`'s `curvature_speed()`) is called by `sim/rollout_core.py`'s
  `use_planner=True` branch at `sim/rollout_core.py:232-234`, which passes
  `v_max=PLANNER_V_MAX, v_min=PLANNER_V_MIN` explicitly — overriding that
  function's own `v_max=15.0, v_min=1.5` defaults. The live side calls the
  same function the same way: `mpc_controller_standalone.py`'s
  `_control_loop` passes `v_max=self._v_max, v_min=self._v_min` (also
  overriding `control_utils.py`'s function defaults) — sourced from the
  `v_max`/`v_min` ROS parameters, which default to the same `20.0`/`1.5`. So
  it's the **call-site arguments** (`PLANNER_V_MAX`/`PLANNER_V_MIN` vs. the
  `v_max`/`v_min` ROS params), not the functions' own default parameter
  values, that must be kept matched — the function defaults themselves are
  never hit in either the offline or live path.
- `a_lat_max=4.0` is the value actually used (as each function's default,
  not overridden at either call site) and must stay identical between
  `sim/speed_profile.py`'s and `control_utils.py`'s `curvature_speed()` — see
  the explicit callout in `sim/speed_profile.py`'s `curvature_speed()`
  docstring, which also notes this is deliberately *different* from
  `compute_speed_profile()`'s own `a_lat_max = mu * g` (≈5.886) convention,
  since that function has no live counterpart to stay matched to.

If a resync changes any of these values or call sites, update both sides in
the same change and re-grep this table's line numbers.

## MPC prediction horizon: frozen target speed

`sim/rollout_core.py`'s (and `mpc_core.py`'s) MPC formulation bakes
`desired_speed` into `x0[4]` (`e_v`) as a single scalar frozen for the whole
prediction horizon — this is a pre-existing architectural characteristic,
not something introduced by this sync, and not a bug. See `README.md`'s
state-vector section (search "e_v's target speed is frozen for the whole
horizon") for the full explanation; not repeated here to avoid duplication.

## Resync procedure

1. Clone/update the sibling `fsae_planning` repo checkout used as the sync
   source (gitignored in this repo, e.g. at `fsae_planning/` in the repo
   root).
2. For each file in the mapping table above, read **both** the old (already
   ported) version and the new upstream version in full before porting
   anything — don't diff-and-patch blind. The one mechanical, unavoidable
   difference: upstream's `planning/` files import each other as
   `from fsae_planning.xxx import yyy` (their ROS 2 package is named
   `fsae_planning`); this repo's package is named `planning`, so every ported
   file needs its intra-package imports rewritten from `fsae_planning.xxx` to
   `planning.xxx` — a one-line-per-import search/replace, not a content
   change. Everything under `fsds_simulator/` has no such rewrite to do: it's
   a byte-for-byte staging mirror of upstream's own package hierarchy (every
   row in the file mapping table above is a "Direct mirror"), so those files
   are already a literal copy-paste at the matching path.
3. Port algorithm changes only, preserving this repo's existing import style
   (for the root `planning/` folder) and the deliberate non-mirrors listed
   above (don't restore a `.v_profile` on `SimPlanner`). `fsds_simulator/`
   mirrors `mpc_controller.py`, `mpc_controller_standalone.py`, and
   `stanley_controller.py` — all three current nodes, not just one — see
   "Two MPC-controller nodes, plus Stanley" above.
4. If the change touches `planning/` or `mpc_core.py`, check per `CLAUDE.md`'s
   numeric-parity rule whether `sim/rollout_core.py` needs a mirrored change —
   `rollout_core.run_core_rollout()` and `mpc_core.MPCController` are two
   implementations of the same control loop kept in deliberate numeric
   parity. Call this out explicitly in the resync notes if a mirrored change
   is or isn't needed.
5. Re-check the numeric-parity constants table above — if upstream changed
   `curvature_speed()`'s `a_lat_max` or the planner speed clamp values, both
   the offline (`sim/speed_profile.py`, `sim/rollout_core.py`) and live
   (`control_utils.py`, `mpc_controller_standalone.py`) copies need the same
   update.
6. Run the smoke-test pattern from `CLAUDE.md`'s Testing section: confirm
   changed files import cleanly, then run `python -m gui.simulation` (or a
   short `python -m tuner.offline_tuner` run with `FAST_TEST_MODE = True` in
   `settings.py`) against one synthetic path and check the rollout still
   converges and tracks correctly. There is no way to test the
   `fsds_simulator/` mirror's ROS 2 files against the real/FSDS car from this
   repo directly — reason through the change against `sim/rollout_core.py`
   instead and flag it for live testing by a human once actually pasted into
   `fsae_planning`.
